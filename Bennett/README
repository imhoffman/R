Bennett pipe organ project.
The Cramer relationship for speed of sound requires pressure, which was not
measured as part of the logging.
The NOAA weather station at the Concord airport logged hourly pressure
measurements for the dates needed.
The web interface referenced in the R script produced monthly files, all but
the first of which were stripped of their header.
The script outputs a plot that quotes the mean and standard deviation (which
is less than 1% of the mean) and, since the Cramer equation is not
particularly sensitive to pressure, these 1% changes are insignificant.
